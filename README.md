# 📊 RGB Histogram Representation in OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to compute and visualize **RGB color histograms** using **OpenCV (`cv2.calcHist`)** and **Matplotlib**.

The code helps you understand how pixel intensities (0–255) are distributed across **Red, Green, and Blue channels**, and how to correctly interpret image histograms.

## 🔹 What You’ll Learn

- What an image histogram represents  
- How `cv2.calcHist()` works in OpenCV  
- Difference between **BGR (OpenCV)** and **RGB (visualization)**  
- Pixel intensity distribution (0–255)  
- Why histograms show **pixel frequency, not image area**  
- Histogram visualization for **single images** and **multiple images from a folder**

---

## 🔹 Key Concept

Each pixel contributes **independently** to:
- Red histogram  
- Green histogram  
- Blue histogram  

Histograms count **pixel values**, not how much of the image looks like a color.
